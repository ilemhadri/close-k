Generating Results from Paper
=============================

Synthetic Examples
------------------

The synthetic examples (Figure 1) can be generated by running
[run_synthetic.sh](run_synthetic.sh).

Simulations
-----------

The simulations can be run with [run_simulation.sh](run_simulation.sh).
This writes the results into log files in `simulation/`. The results are
parsed by [analysis.py](analysis.py), which generates Figure 5.

Main Experiments
----------------

The main experiments can be run with [run_experiments.sh](run_experiments.sh).
This writes the results into log files in `l/`. The results are
parsed by [analysis.py](analysis.py), which generates the figures and tables.
